# The Chalmers Cloud Ice Climatology (CCIC)

The CCIC dataset comprises multidecadal AI-powered cloud retrievals continuously covering all longitudes between 60ยบ S and 60ยบ N. A convolutional neural network is used to infer cloud properties from only one channel of geostationary satellite images from either the CPCIR {cite}`Janowiak_2001_RealTime, Janowiak_2017_CPCIR` or GridSat {cite}`Knapp_2014_CDR, knapp_2011_gridsat` data products. The retrieval implementation and its validation has been described in an pre-print recently published in EGUSphere {cite}`amell_2023_ccic`. Suggested analyses of the CCIC data include, among others, long-term climate analyses and studies of cloud processes.
